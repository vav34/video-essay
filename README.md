### Summary
This video essay introduces the phenomena of anime watchers not being able to move on from Attack on Titan by Hajime Isayama. Why do so many people struggle to switch to a new anime after finishing the series? I plan to tackle this question by highlighting how it parallels Mikasa's feeling of loneliness at the end of the series. I also intend to shed light on the aspects of the series that differ drastically from shows of the same genre to further my point. Considering Isayama's methodical construction of his story, it is possible this is exactly what he intended.
